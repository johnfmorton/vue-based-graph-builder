# Vue Animated Bar Graph Builder

This isn't a project for anyone to use for a real purpose. It's just something I am building to explore Vue development with. It stores the state using Vuex. It integrates Greensock Animation Platform in a basic way. 

To see the magic in action, see the [live project page](https://johnfmorton.github.io/vue-based-graph-builder).
